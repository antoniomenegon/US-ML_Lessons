# US-ML_Lessons
This repository is the collection of the two lessons delivered as a general introduction to _Neural Networks_. In particular:
1. In the [Presentations][1] one can find the two Power Point documents that have been presented in the lessons
2. In the [Code][2] folder, as one can imagine, one can find the Google Colab with the sample code.
